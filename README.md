Question 1:

Application Description: Suppose there is one bank company – Commonwealth that requires you to develop a relational database. The daily duty is to serve their customers managing their saving bank accounts, e.g., withdraw, deposit, etc. Additionally, the company Commonwealth also makes business for the home loan marketing, e.g., a customer may have a home loan account. To set up a home loan account for a customer, there are several information to be collected and recorded: (1) the customer needs to specify a property address; (2) a bank staff needs to be assigned to process the home loan application; (3) the property value should be assessed by using the average of the sold price of the properties located in the same suburb. Note: suppose there are sold properties in every suburbs; (4) Each customer has their own home loan max limit that is calculated by his/her 10 years annual salary plus 0.65*property value plus customer savings (amount in his accounts): Note: property value is based on avg sold price of that suburb. Note: In general, the bank company used 10 years’ salary to estimate, e.g., if the customer Kevin has annual income $60,000, then his home loan limit cannot exceed $600,000. For the customers having multiple home loans, their total home load amount cannot exceed the customers’ home loan limit; (5) a customer may have more than one home loan because multiple properties can be bought by one customer. Last but not least, your design should reflect the practical requirement as much as possible, i.e., meeting the maximum business rules. For example, some customers may have home loan accounts, but some ones may only have saving accounts. For a customer who need to set up a home loan account, it must create a saving account first. The average sold price for a suburb should be calculated on demand, not saved directly in the database. (6) A customer may have more than one back account. (7). A loan may be associated with more than one customer as joint loan (8) In case of join loan, the database records the loan/joint customer to compute borrowing capacity and total loan of the property.

Draw the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the database designed for the above application scenario. In the ERD, you need to specify the main components including Entities, Attributes, Relationships, Primary Keys, and Constraints.

Question 2:

Aladin Distributor Pt. (ADp) is an international supplier company located in Melbourne, Australia. The company purchase products from markets majorly from China and India, then sells these products to different stores/companies such as Coles, Woolworth as well as other small superstores such as Indian Mart, China-SuperStore, Indian Groceries etc.

Currently, the company has a paper-based system to manage its product acquisition and sales records. Obviously, the current system is prone to errors and slow to respond to inquiries from each regional department store. ADp is hiring your company to develop a database management system to improve the process. Your company asked you to design an ERD that reflect the business need of Asp.

ADp has contract with several local companies (suppliers) in India and China. To shorten your requirement analysis, relevant departments at ADp have provided you the following information:

Product Supplier: The product supplier information includes a unique supplier ID, supplier name (e.g., a company name), address, phone and email. While a supplier may have several phones and email, at present only two phone and two email are recorded on the company information. The required information about a supplier includes supplier ID, supplier name, supplier address, supplier phone and supplier email.

Product: A product ordered by Aladin Distributor Pt. from potential suppliers in China, India etc. The information about a product includes product identifier, product name, product description, and quantity-on-hand. The required information for a product includes product ID and name.

Purchase: A purchase order between Aladin Distributor Pt. and a particular supplier. The purchase order information includes the unique order number, order date, and arrival date. Certainly, it also includes relevant information about the supplier, product, and the purchasing manager who handles the purchase order. Note that some of this data is to be included via relationships between the related entities. Once a purchase order is made, the following information must be provided: order number, order date, and order quantity.

Purchase Item: A purchase item represents a particular product ordered in a given purchase order. The basic information about a line item includes an item number, quantity ordered, and unit cost. A purchase item must be related to a purchase order and a particular product. The required information for a purchase item includes item number and quantity ordered.

Customer Company: A customer company (Desi Mart, China-SuperStore, Indian etc) is a potential department store to which Aladin sells the products. The information about a customer includes company name (e.g., Desi Mart), address, and phone.

Sales List: This list includes all potential buyer companies (Desi Mart, China-SuperStore, Indian etc) for a particular product. The list contains information about the customer company, product, and the last transaction date on which the customer made a purchase of that product. If there is no transaction between the customer and product, then the date is left empty. The list is updated regularly.

Note that the above description has addressed only the “entities” involved in the data model. Additional information about the relationships between entities is summarized below:
